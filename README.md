# transaction dashboard

Python application to display fake transactions in basic HTML from a mock bank using the TrueLayer API.

## Installation

Download the project using git clone:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/sarahseewhy/transaction-dashboard.git
```

## Usage

### Requirements

You must have `pyenv`, `python3`, `pip3`, and `pipenv` installed in order to install, run, and test the app. If you use a mac and don't have Python configured, [this is a helpful guide](https://opensource.com/article/19/5/python-3-default-mac).

The app uses a `.env` file to set required environment variables.

Create a `.env` file in the root project directory and add the following configuration:

```text
CLIENT_ID=********
SECRET_ID=********
REDIRECT_URL=********
FLASK_ENV=development | production 
```

The `CLIENT_ID` and `SECRET_ID` values are found in the TrueLayer console. Please use the [TrueLayer documentation](https://docs.truelayer.com/#overview) to set this up.

`REDIRECT_URL` value will be a hostname (e.g., `localhost`) and port (e.g., `5000`), plus the redirect route configured in `routes.py` (for this project that would be `authenticate/callback`). The value will also need to be set in the TrueLayer console.

You can decide whether to set the `FLASK_ENV` value to be "development" or "production" based on your needs.

### Installing dependencies

The project contains a Makefile which is used to install, run, and test the app. All commands are run from the root project directory.

First install the required packages:

```bash
$ make install
```

### Running

Run the app using the `run` Make command:

```bash
$ make run
```

**Then navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/authenticate` in Chrome or Firefox and give it a whirl!**

Note: Safari is not supported.

### Testing
The Makefile is also responsible for running tests:

```bash
$ make test
```

## Roadmap

There were a few parts of this project I wanted to get to or that were particularly perplexing and I've recorded them here as reflections. 

### Additional functionality

The app should display an aggregated set of all the transactions, maybe next time!

### Testing

The app needs needs unit tests, integration tests (to the TrueLayer API), and Selenium-based tests to test the HTML rendering.

I began the TDD process but got stuck trying to stub and mock the TrueLayer API requests. I timeboxed the task but reached the limit of my Python testing knowledge and didn't want to exceed the timebox.

**Update**: I read a bit more into testing with Python.

I'd go back and experiment with `pytest-mock`. I didn't give it enough of a go.

In the previous Python app I worked on I was mocking and stubbing AWS calls so used `botocore`. I also briefly tried `monkey-patch` but it was difficult to read and readability is really important when it comes to tests.

I'm more comfortable TDDing in Java which says to me I need to practice more Python!

It'd be neat to have a Python mocking library specifically for the TrueLayer API.

### Logging

Even a basic layer of logging would help with debugging issues.

I used Python's `logging` library for debugging but decided against leaving it in the app.

There were some interesting debug situations where I could see a `400 Bad Request` response in the browser but it was not reflected in the logging. I'd love to get to the bottom of that.

### Error handling

The code is written optimistically and errors aren't handled with the try/catch blocks I'm used to seeing in Python.

The one block I added I ultimately removed because without tests I didn't have the same trust in its effectiveness.

### Caching and asynchronous API calls

I would've liked to implement async API calls to the TrueLayer API so the app wouldn't query the API for transaction data with every request.

Caching or saving data in a sensible manner would've also been a nice to have.

**Update**: I did a bit of research on saving data.

I'd introduce Flask's built in `session` functionality to save the authentication access code instead of the `global` variable.

I experimented with using `session` for saving the transactions in memory but the "cookie is too large" (not a problem with real cookies üç™). A `session` can only store 4KB and the transaction data was 19KB. 

If I still didn't want to use a database, I'd try dumping the data in a json file and loading it to display the transactions. I'd have to create a flag to establish whether to load the data from a file or to make an API call. Using `session` could be one option (I need to think this through though), checking if the file exists or if it has contents is another.

If I went down the database route I'd have to do some more research to figure out which tool is best for the job. I read about [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) and best practices for financial transaction databases, but I need to do more research.

Regarding asynchronous calls, I confused two concepts: saving the data and error handling. My brain wires got crossed.

Using TrueLayer's `async=true` flag would be useful for error handling, though we're reaching the limits of my web app knowledge.

### Docker

I initially added a Dockerfile and configured `docker-compose`. I successfully ran the app using Docker on Friday but when I returned on Sunday night to do some refactoring I got a `400 Bad Request` response from TrueLayer when I hit the `/authenticate` route.

I suspect the root cause is host configuration between the container, the app, and the allowed redirect URLs.

I've left the Dockerfile and the docker-compose.yml in the project for others to get a sense of the direction I took.

**Update**: I figured this out. I needed to install `python-dotenv` in the Dockerfile to enable Flask to read the values in `.env`. 

### Terraform

The Python Flask app I worked on previously was deployed on AWS Lambda and I wanted to go in this direction.

It would've been fun to deploy the app to a Lambda but this was out of scope of the task. 

**Update**: If I'd gone down this route I would've started with something very simple: 

- A Lambda serving the Python app
- Cloudfront for any static content (not needed at this point but worth mentioning)
- API Gateway to allow access from the interwebs
- Basic VPC and networking configuration
- Route53 to give the app a sensible domain

We'd run into some interesting decisions when it comes to saving data because Lambdas are meant to be stateless. 

It's possible to do in-app caching, saving _some_ data to `/tmp` on the Lambda. Perhaps that's a first step.

Other possibilities which I read about but have not tried were: ElastiCache or EC2(Redis/Memcached). [This was a helpful read](https://blog.thundra.io/caching-with-aws-serverless-applications).

### Styling

Please forgive the simple HTML and default Times New Roman. It's a bit of an eye-sore but styling was out of scope.
